**Lazy Viewport 1.2**

Blender 4.0 updated!

**What does it do?**

A simple addon for blender to map the standard G, R, S hotkeys to the view tools, so you don't have to use the snapping hotkeys X, Y, Z. 

**Instructions:**
1. Remove any older version of lazy viewport that you may have installed. 
2. Download the .zip file using the green button "Code" and then the drop menu button "download zip"
3. Extract the zip.
4. In blender, go to Preferecens>Addons>Install and navigate to your extracted lazyviewport.py 
5. When installing, select the python file, not the folder. 

Once installed, use G, R, S with the user friendly viewport gizmo tools :) 

**Edge/Vert Slide:**

Use shift+v. You can also do these via the menus in edit mode. 
The standard "G" then "G" does not work with the standard Blender view tools, thus not working with the Lazy Viewport Add On. 

**Rotation Snap:**

Use ctrl+left click to snap incrementally. 
The standard stapping with the 90 degree hotkeys oes not work with the standard Blender view tools, thus not working with the Lazy Viewport Add On. 

**Adjust Proportional Editing:**

This one is a little tricky! While move the object, using middle mouse to scroll and adjust the size of the propportional editing ring. You must left click and drag to edit and while your editing, then using middle mouse, using the left click and middle mouse at the same time. 

**Scale Snapping:**

While dragging on an axis, you can utalize the zero key to snap. 
Rotation: Use Ctrl + Left Click and drag on an axis to snap incrementally. 

Yay for lazyness!
